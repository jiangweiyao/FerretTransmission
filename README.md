# Code for Ferret Transmission Paper

Both scripts are for analysis of the transmission data from TnSeq outputs in our paper: Bacterial Factors required for Transmission of Streptococcus pneumoniae in Mammalian Hosts, in revision at Cell Host Microbe.

The TnSeq insert comparison is comparing the unique inserts present in donor and contact animals to determine bottlenecks of transmission.

The ferret microbiome analysis script is to determine the probability of transmission to contact animals for all the inserts across each gene, based on density in the donor animals, versus the observed transmission to contact animals.
